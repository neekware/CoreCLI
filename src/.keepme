# Your Business Logic Goes Here

This directory is for your core application code. Keep your CLI commands in `commands/subs/` 
and your business logic here in `src/`.

Example structure:
```
src/
└── myproject/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── core.py
    ├── models.py
    └── utils.py
```

Then import in your CLI commands:
```python
from src.myproject.core import MyBusinessLogic
```
